There's a local nodejs app...which has its own README.  You should.  That runs the lightbulb stuff.

The org is slightly modified from the EinsteinVision repo, doing some nifty platform event streaming.

I've trained a hardhat model--you'd have to make your own if you don't have access to the org.

Model names should be NoHardHat and HasHardHat.  I may, in a moment of laziness, hardcoded the model ID.  Adjust accordingly in apex.

Einstein's setup has changed a bit--you may have to redo the auth stuff if you create an account today vs. when this was done.  It's a tiny modification.
